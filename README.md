# Keras-Neural-Network-data-Prediction-Model--Drug-Side-Effects-Problem
This is a project in which we suppose that there is a drug manufacturing and which has side effects on 95% of older population and 5% on younger population in a city. We are also creating the data ourselves and a neural network ,specifically designed for our problem, in Keras (Tensorflow)
